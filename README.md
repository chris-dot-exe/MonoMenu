# MonoMenu
A menu library built on u8g2 for monochrome displays to quickly create a nice looking menu for your project!

## WORK IN PROGRESS
At the moment it (probably) works only with 128x64px displays etc. 

It is only used in one project and may fail if used in your project...
don't use if you're looking for something stable!
